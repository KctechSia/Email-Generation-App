# Email-Generation-App

This project contains two versions of an AI-powered email generator:

Android App (`android-app`)
Built with Kotlin in Android Studio, this mobile version allows users to:
- Input prompts (e.g., "ask for sick leave")
- Generate formal email responses using OpenAI API
- View generated email on the screen

Web Version (`web-version`)
Built with Python (Flask), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Replit, this version lets users:
- Enter a prompt directly in the browser
- Send it to the backend (Flask server)
- View the generated response using OpenAI API

Features
- Simple UI for user input
- Backend integration with OpenAI's GPT model
- Works both as a mobile app and a web platform

Technologies Used
- Kotlin, Android SDK
- Python, Flask
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- OpenAI API
- Replit (for web hosting)

Purpose
This app was created to help users generate polite and structured emails quickly. It’s especially useful for professionals, students, and anyone learning prompt engineering or NLP concepts.

Inspiration
This project is part of a learning journey in data analysis, machine learning, and real-world app development.
This project was developed as part of my learning process in data analysis and natural language processing (NLP). By building this Email Generator App, I explored how user-generated prompts can be structured, passed to a machine learning model (OpenAI's GPT), and processed to return meaningful text outputs. The project involved working with APIs, JSON data formats, and real-time data flow between a frontend and backend, mimicking the kind of pipelines used in real-world data systems. It also taught me the fundamentals of prompt engineering, which is crucial in NLP applications, and helped me understand how to transform unstructured inputs into structured results. Through deploying the app and debugging cross-platform integration, I also gained experience in handling data exchange errors, environment setup, and version control. Overall, this project demonstrates how data-driven tools are designed, implemented, and deployed—turning raw input into valuable, user-friendly outcomes—and reflects my progress toward becoming a job-ready data analyst.
